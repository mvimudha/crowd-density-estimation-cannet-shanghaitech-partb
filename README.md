# ðŸ§  Crowd Density Estimation with CANNet (ShanghaiTech Part B)

This project implements a **VGG16-based CANNet** architecture to estimate crowd density using the ShanghaiTech Part B dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Gaussian heatmap generation from head annotations
- Achieved **MAE of 20** using tuning and augmentations
- Visualizes both predicted and ground-truth densities

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

- PyTorch
- NumPy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“„ File

- `CANNet_ShanghaiTech_PartB.ipynb`: Full Colab notebook including training, testing, and visualization

## ðŸ“Š Results

MAE: 20 (mean absolute error)
